## Configuring database ##

Follow these steps to import `data_pump file`.

### Using impdp oracle tool ###
To import data_pump file you can use one of the following two ways:

##### First choice
Copy dump file (here`data_pump_SRNI_DD_MM_YYYY_KFUTURE.dmp`) to default data pump folder which you can find with the following query:
```javascript
select DIRECTORY_PATH from DBA_DIRECTORIES where DIRECTORY_NAME = 'DATA_PUMP_DIR';
```
Note: In your database there must be a user KFUTURE without objects.

Now you can import dump file by executing the following command in the command prompt:
```javascript
impdp KFUTURE/KFUTURE@database_net_service_name SCHEMAS=KFUTURE dumpfile=data_pump_SRNI_DD_MM_YYYY_KFUTURE.dmp logfile=data_pump_SRNI_DD_MM_YYYY_KFUTURE.log
```
where 'database_net_service_name' should be replaced with the service name of the database you are importing into.


##### Second choice - Importing to a local XE database
Rename dump file `data_pump_SRNI_DD_MM_YYYY_KFUTURE.dmp` to `EXPDAT.dmp` and copy this file to folder `C:\oraclexe\app\oracle\admin\XE\dpdump` on your computer.
If there is already user KFUTURE in the database it should be removed with the following command:
```javascript 
DROP USER KFUTURE CASCADE;
```
Than re-create user KFUTURE with the following commands:
```javascript 
CREATE USER KFUTURE IDENTIFIED BY KFUTURE DEFAULT TABLESPACE "USERS";
GRANT "DBA" TO KFUTURE;
```
Now you can import dump file with the following command issued in command prompt: 
```javascript 
impdp KFUTURE/KFUTURE
```
